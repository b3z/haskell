-- Welcome to the great world of haskell.
-- We like weed and cats.

-- first of all how to use the SimplePrelude and the fortprog-ghci
import SimplePrelude

-- run the fortprog-ghci and then type ":load 00_intro.hs" to load a file.
-- If you change something you can do ":r" to reload the file.

-- Hello world
-- There is no such thing I guess but you can try to display a string.

hello = "Hello World"

-- now just type "hello" in your terminal and it will print the variable for you.
-- That's it.


-- Also you can play arounf with the ghci shell and do mathematical operations like
-- 2 + 2 or 1337 / 42
-- True && False
-- not False
-- 1 == 1
-- "same1" == "same?"
